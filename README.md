# 3D Scene Flow for Mesh-Subject Correspondence Tracking

In this project we have used various techniques to track human movement and then establish a correspondance between the human movement and the movement of an artificial 3D mesh. The human movements were tracked using deep learning models and the correspondance between the human subject and the artificial mesh was established by using the appropriate trasnforms from the 2 frames of references.
